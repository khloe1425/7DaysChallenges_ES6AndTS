      In the night I hear 'em talk
      The coldest story ever told
      Somewhere far along this road
      He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
      
      How could you be so heartless?
      Oh, how could you be so heartless?
      
      How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
      Just remember that you talkin' to me though
      You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
      I mean after all the things that we've been through
      I mean after all the things we got into
      Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
      Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
      And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
      So you walk around like you don't know me
      You got a new friend, well I got homies
      But in the end it's still so lonely
      In the night I hear 'em talk
      The coldest story ever told
      Somewhere far along this road
      He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
      How could you be so heartless?
      Oh, how could you be so heartless?
